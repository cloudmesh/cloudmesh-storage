    This class specifies a storage object queue, that allows the queuing of
    files to be copied between services.

    The queue has a maximal parallelism that can be set to execute the copy in
    multiple threads.

    Please note that actions only add modify the queue in the db, however,
    the run command executes them one by one.

    It will be up to thes method to quarantee order. For example, in case of a
    recursive copy it wwould make sens to create directories first.
